# io_scene_lithtech

This addon is forked from [io_scene_abc](https://github.com/cmbasnett/io_scene_abc), renamed to io_scene_lithtech due to the increased scope. 

This addon provides limited support for importing and exporting various Lithtech models formats from [No One Lives Forever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Operative:_No_One_Lives_Forever) to and from Blender 2.8x.

## Supported Formats

Format | Import | Export
--- | --- | ---
ABC | Rigid and Skeletal | Limited
LTA | No | Rigid and Skeletal
LTB (PS2) | Rigid and Skeletal | No
LTB (PC) | No | No

The ABC file format description can be found on our wiki [here](https://github.com/cmbasnett/io_scene_abc/wiki/ABC).

Additional format information can be found in [here](https://github.com/haekb/io_scene_lithtech/tree/master/research)
